	<h2>Are you looking for a photographer for your big day?
 Then you are in the right place.</h2>
 <div class="main">
<p>
I know that your wedding is a unique and unforgettable day, and I want to 
capture every moment, every emotion, and every detail with my camera. I am 
Manuel, and I have had the privilege of immortalising a lot of weddings all 
around Europe.</p><p>
 Let me tell you about my way of working so you can get to know me better. I 
adapt to your style and preferences. It's your day, and we want to capture the 
love, magic, and essence of it all. I will be discreetly attentive to the most 
important and spontaneous moments during your celebration.</p><p>
 In the photos you will receive, you will see everything from loving glances, 
tender kisses, to the most sincere laughter. I assure you that I will accompany 
you in those moments and capture them with the artistic and authentic style 
that characterises my shots. My work goes beyond just taking thousands of 
photos; it's about creating a pleasant and enjoyable experience for you and 
your guests on that day and helping you tell that story for a lifetime.</p><p>
 I know what it feels like to be in front of the camera, which is why I strive to 
build a personal connection with you and your loved ones. My goal is to make 
you relax and fully enjoy your day while I take care of creating the most 
beautiful memories.</p><p>
 By choosing me as your photographer, you are choosing someone committed 
and with a trained eye for details. My objective is to exceed your expectations 
and deliver a visual treasure that will last forever.</p><p>
 I am excited to meet you and help you preserve this part of your love story. I 
invite you to take a look at my portfolio and discover my style.</p>
